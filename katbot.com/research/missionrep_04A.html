        After school I intercepted a telephone call from Paula to June. It was 
        an accident of course; I find that my antennae tend to pick up cellular 
        and cordless phone reception when I hold my head certain angles. <br>
        <br>
        Attached is a transcript of the of the conversation: <br>
        <br>
        (ring ring) <br>
        <br>
        (click) <br>
        <br>
        June: "Hello?" <br>
        <br>
        Mrs. LeBore: "Helloo!" <br>
        <br>
        Paula: "Hello? June?" <br>
        <br>
        Mrs. LeBore: "No, this is not June, whom may I say is calling?" <br>
        <br>
        June: "Ma, I got the phone &#150; hang up!" <br>
        <br>
        Mrs. LeBore: "All right sweetie, no need to yell." <br>
        <br>
        (click) <br>
        <br>
        June (groans): "Ugh! What is it Paula?" <br>
        <br>
        Paula: "You're <b>never</b> going to believe what happened. I was driving 
        home after school today, right? And just as I was making that hairy turn 
        downtown some old lady in a Lincoln Towncar plowed right into me! I couldn't 
        believe it! She could barely see over the steering wheel for Christ's 
        sake. My car is <b>so fucked!</b> My dad said it will be in the shop for 
        <b>weeks</b>. Weeks! Weeks with out my little silver bullet! What am I 
        going to do? Ugh! I can't imagine not having a car, having to rely on 
        other people to drive me around like a little baby! I should just strap 
        my self into a car seat!" <br>
        <br>
        June (tersely): "I don't have a car. I'm not a baby." <br>
        <br>
        Paula: "Haha, I didn't mean <b>you</b> were a baby, June. I'm sure your 
        parent's will get you a car when you're old enough to drive." <br>
        <br>
        June: "Uh huh." <br>
        <br>
        Paula: "Anyway, the reason I called was this: Rotten Goat is playing at 
        Starky's tonight, and I <b>really</b>, <b>really</b> want to go. Actually, 
        I <b>have</b> to go. John said he might be there. Anyway, my dad won't 
        let me borrow his car cos there's a league game that night and anyway 
        he thinks the accident might have been my fault, even though anyone with 
        half a brain could tell that old lady was wack. So I thought maybe, you 
        know, we could borrow your dad's car." <br>
        <br>
        June: "Are you on <b>crack</b> or something? My dad isn't going to let 
        us borrow his car. I, like, don't even have a learner's permit yet, and 
        you just totaled your car. Besides, he is obsessed with that car. You'd 
        think he'd pick a better car to lust after. Who likes Pintos anyway??" 
        <br>
        <br>
        Paula: "Well, you know, we could <b>borrow</b> it with out asking, and 
        then bring it back later. Like after they go to sleep. They'll never know." 
        <br>
        <br>
        (pause) <br>
        <br>
        June: "So, basically, you want to steal my dad's car." <br>
        <br>
        Paula: "Well, when you put it that way it sounds so illegal! We would 
        just borrow it. For one night only." <br>
        <br>
        June: "I don't know Paula." <br>
        <br>
        Paula: "Your cute lead singer's band is opening the show..." <br>
        <br>
        June: "Really?" <br>
        <br>
        (click) <br>
        <br>
        Mrs. LeBore: "June darling, it's time for dinner!" <br>
        <br>
        June: "Mom! This is a private call! Who are you? Big Brother?!" <br>
        <br>
        Mrs. LeBore: "I'm sorry sweetie, I don't like yelling up the stairs. Just 
        come down for dinner." <br>
        <br>
        (click) <br>
        <br>
        June: "So what time do you think we should leave?" <br>
        <br>
        Just then the transmission was interrupted by static caused by the microwave 
        Mrs. LeBore was using to heat up frozen corn. <br>
        <br>
        I must find a way to go with them.<br>
