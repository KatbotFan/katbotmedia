        Saturday afternoon I accompanied my "host family" to a Parent Teacher 
        Association Crafts Fair, which was held in the high school cafeteria. 
        Mrs. LeBore is involved in some capacity with the so-called PTA. Upon 
        arriving, she immediately commandeered a table on which to display her 
        crafts. <br>
        <br>
        The girl, June, looked rather glum on our way over to the high school 
        and immediately separated herself from the familial unit on our arrival. 
        Her defection afforded me some time to observe her parents. <br>
        <br>
        Mrs. LeBore came baring a box of hand made items she fabricates in her 
        spare time. Mr. LeBore followed behind another box of similar objects. 
        <br>
        <br>
        They were greeted warmly by the other adults who were busily setting up 
        tables with knitted doilies, animal like creatures created entirely out 
        of fluffy, brightly colored acrylic based wool, and sacred idols used 
        to decorate one's house during the upcoming holiday, Halloween. I was 
        introduced to more adults that I could compute. All were friendly and 
        extremely curious about me and the "country" from whence I came. I entertained 
        them with a few words of broken English describing my "homeland" as "pretty" 
        but "harsh". I expressed how glad I was to be in America, which tickled 
        them to no end. These people were extremely friendly and very ready to 
        share their pride in their country. One portly gentleman gave me a lecture 
        on the American work ethic. After much nodding and squirming, I was able 
        to free myself and wander off in search of the young people. They sat 
        in sullen groups on out in the playing fields behind the school. They 
        seemed very whiny to me, but I could understand their irritation: I, too, 
        remember the disappointment of the beginning of a new learning year. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="../../research/img/missionrpt_04_02_bleachers.gif" width="208" height="157" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="under the bleachers">I 
        scanned the field and sensed that June was near. As I canvassed the football 
        field, I spotted June, Paula (the talkative girl), and a skinny spotted 
        boy crouched down under the bleachers. There was a cloud of sweet smelling 
        smoke surrounding them. They were laughing about nothing I could discern. 
        They did not see me. I decided not to intrude. I do not want to force 
        myself on June. I can get more research done if I wait until she thaws 
        to me. <br>
        <br>
        I wandered to the opposite end of the playing field and lay down under 
        a large oak tree. I powered my processor down into rest mode. After 35 
        minutes I rejoined the LeBore family in the cafeteria. <br>
        <br>
        Something strange happened then. When I appeared, June (who had returned 
        from the bleachers) stared at me rather intently. Her eyes were a little 
        red, and she had a look of absolute shock on her face. I got this weird 
        feeling that my Hypno-Fa&ccedil;ade had accidentally been turned off, 
        but it hadn't. I don't know what happened, but I must be extra careful 
        around her. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="../../research/img/missionrpt_04_03_june.gif" width="208" height="157" align="right" alt="June w/ bloodshot eyes">The 
        rest of the fair was rather uneventful. When we returned home June ran 
        up to her room and did not emerge until Paula picked her up. I wonder 
        where they have gone...</p>
