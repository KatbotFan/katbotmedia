        The question as to whether or not I would be invited to the show at Starky's 
        was settled thusly: the cover charge was $7. I was the only one with money 
        to spare. I did not mind paying for June and Paula, as the money is supplied 
        to me by the KSA as part of my work expenses. <br>
        <br>
        Paula's father dropped her off at the LeBore home on his way to his bowling 
        match. She arrived with a sleeping bag and a stack of videocassettes. 
        <br>
        <br>
        At 9:00 PM, the girls changed into their sleeping attire. I set my Hypno-Fa&ccedil;ade 
        to accommodate this change (Paula complimented my pink pajamas), and we 
        all convened in the family room. Mrs. LeBore brought us some freshly popped 
        popcorn and a large plate of home made chocolate chip cookies. She also 
        supplied milk. <br>
        <br>
        "You girls have fun now. Don't stay up too late or you'll be a mess in 
        the morning!" <br>
        <br>
        This comment resulted in more eye rolling from June. <br>
        <br>
        "Ma, it's a sleep over. You're supposed to stay up all night." <br>
        <br>
        "All right. But you know how cranky you get when you're tired." <br>
        <br>
        "That's OK, Mrs. LeBore. Me and Katerina will make sure she goes to bed 
        early. Then we'll stay up all night and watch videos!" <br>
        <br>
        Mrs. LeBore chuckled as she walked out of the room. "Good night, girls." 
        <br>
        <br>
        "Night!" <br>
        <br>
        The three of us listened as Mrs. LeBore padded up the stairs in her fuzzy 
        slippers. We heard the master bedroom door close with a soft click. <br>
        <br>
        "We should probably wait a while before we go," June said. "I want to 
        be sure they're really asleep." <br>
        <br>
        "Well, in the mean time," Paula held up two of the videocassettes she 
        brought. "What should it be? 'Heathers' or 'Beaches'?" <br>
        <br>
        "'Beaches'? Are you kidding?" June said as she screwed up her face in 
        a mass of wrinkled nose and mouth. "'Heathers.'" <br>
        <br>
        Two hours later June and Paula rushed around quietly, getting ready to 
        sneak out. Paula shook her hair out to even larger proportions, while 
        June applied lipstick the exact shade of dried human blood. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="img/missionrpt_05_02_stars.gif" width="208" height="157" align="left" hspace="5" vspace="5">When 
        they completed preening, they tip-toed (shoeless) through the kitchen 
        and out the door. It was a cool, clear night. Some stars were visible 
        and I tried to locate the exact pinpoint of light from whence I came, 
        but the street lamps and air pollution obliterated much of the nighttime 
        universe. June and Paula quickly put on their shoes and proceeded to open 
        the garage door, a process which took approximately fifteen painstaking 
        minutes. <br>
        <br>
        "Shhhh! Don't go too fast or they'll hear it!" June admonished. <br>
        <br>
        "Uh..." Paula groaned. "Doesn't your dad ever oil this freaking thing? 
        It's, like, super rusty!" <br>
        <br>
        "Shhh!" June hissed. <br>
        <br>
        I walked to the end of the driveway and looked at the master bedroom window 
        where the LeBore's were sleeping peacefully. They had no idea what sort 
        of mischief was brewing down in their front yard. <br>
        <br>
        The garage door was finally agape, and the girls crept into its musty 
        shadows. I followed. June handed Paula the keys she swiped off the key 
        rack in the kitchen. Paula opened the door, got in and then unlocked the 
        other door for June and me. <br>
        <br>
        "I got dibs on front," June whispered to me. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="img/missionrpt_05_03_car.gif" width="208" height="157" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">When 
        we were all pleasantly situated, Paula put the key in the ignition and 
        paused. "What's this?" she said, placing her hand on the stick shift. 
        "And why are there three pedals?" <br>
        <br>
        "It's a stick shift, Paula. You can drive stick, right? Please tell me 
        you can." <br>
        <br>
        "Oh yeah, I did once, when I was learning. Peter, that guy I dated for 
        three weeks back in 11th grade, I think he had a stick. He drove a Mustang, 
        I think. Anyway, that had to be, like, the worst car to make out in. My 
        God! So cramped!" <br>
        <br>
        "Paula." <br>
        <br>
        "Oh, right. Maybe we could take your mom's car instead," Paula said, nodding 
        towards Mrs. LeBore's Autumn Orange Ford Explorer 4 door SUV. <br>
        <br>
        "Are you kidding? She just got that car. It cost $30,000." <br>
        <br>
        "But it's an automatic right?" <br>
        <br>
        "Damn it Paula." <br>
        <br>
        "It's your call, June." <br>
        <br>
        "Let's just go. I don't want to sneak back in and get the other keys." 
        <br>
        <br>
        Paula turned the key and the garage was suddenly filled with the teeth 
        vibrating sound of grinding gears. <br>
        <br>
        "Ooop! Sorry about that." <br>
        <br>
        June turned a shade paler and clenched her jaw. <br>
        <br>
        We jerked fitfully backwards down the driveway and proceeded down the 
        street. Paula's driving style was a cross between drunken teenager and 
        near sighted octogenarian. <br>
        <br>
        "Whoo! I'm not used to driving a stick! This is hard! But I'll get a hang 
        of it soon. The next time, it will go a lot smoother." <br>
        <br>
        "What next time?" June grumbled, her knuckles white and extended from 
        gripping the door and seat. <br>
        <br>
        After about fifteen minutes of Paula's erratic driving we reached Starky's, 
        a rather bleak looking shack like edifice located in what I have since 
        discovered is called a "strip mall." A strip mall is basically a long 
        parking lot located right off a highway or road. Adjoining the parking 
        lot is a long line of stores, most of which are attached to one another. 
        Aside from the rundown Starky's, this particular strip mall consisted 
        of Dunkin' Donuts, Jimmy's Pizza Ristorante, Hollywood Video, Carlita's 
        Buns 'n Things, and Pudgies Famous Chicken. <br>
        <br>
        The music coming out of Starky's was pounding. When the door opened, billows 
        of smoke poured out as if the place were ablaze. I'm glad I am not tall, 
        as the fresh air is located close to the ground. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="img/missionrpt_05_04_bouncer.gif" width="208" height="157" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">A 
        young woman straight out of that punk rock movie "Sid &amp; Nancy" manned 
        the door. I can't tell which was less welcoming, the mean looking spikes 
        on her dog collar or the offensive look on her face. She sneered as we 
        came closer and June whispered to Paula, "Is she gonna let us in or eat 
        us for dinner?" <br>
        <br>
        "You just let me handle this," Paula whispered back. "Hey!" she said, 
        grinning at the dour looking gatekeeper. "We're here for the Rotten Goat 
        show. Nars, the drummer, is my cousin and he told me to tell whoever was 
        at the door what band we were here for so they could get paid. It's seven 
        bucks, right? I sure hope we brought enough money, heh heh." <br>
        <br>
        I assumed this was my cue to present the cash, but before I could get 
        it out, a blas&eacute; voice intoned, "IDs?" <br>
        <br>
        Paula laughed and June shifted from one foot to another. Digging through 
        her ample shoulder bag, Paula searched for the proof of age we all knew 
        she did not possess. <br>
        <br>
        "It's in here somewhere... where is it? Wait, is that it? No, just my 
        library card. You know, I'm always losing things, I'm such an idiot!" 
        <br>
        <br>
        "So, you drove here with no license?" <br>
        <br>
        "She must have if she can't find it." June said caustically to the woman 
        blocking our entrance. <br>
        <br>
        Just then some tall men with sticker laden guitar cases walked by. One 
        of them stopped when he saw June.<br>
        <br>
        "Hey, you're the girl I drove home from that party we played out in Massapequa! 
        What's up?" <br>
        <br>
        June flushed slightly but quickly regained her composure. <br>
        <br>
        "We're trying to get in, but the warden here won't let us." <br>
        <br>
        "Awww, come on Sylvie, let 'm in. I'll keep and eye on them and make sure 
        they don't drink." He smiled at the improbably named Sylvie until she 
        relented and smiled back. I handed her $21 and we entered. <br>
        <br>
        We followed the as of yet unnamed lead singer towards the small stage. 
        June walked along silently; she seemed not to know where to look. Paula 
        kept up a stream of nonsensical banter, which I fortunately could not 
        understand due to the loud music. The lead singer and his cohorts went 
        about setting up their instruments as Paula yelled, June stared and I 
        surveyed the scene. Starky's is a small venue, and I had no trouble scanning 
        the 54 occupants of the room with one sweeping glance. They were all much 
        older than June and Paula, although they were perhaps a little younger 
        than the Earth equivalent of my true age. <br>
        <br>
        June stared intently at a green photocopied flyer she found on the floor. 
        It announced the opening act as having the unappealing name of "Meat Nipple." 
        Since we were watching the opening act set up just then, I felt safe to 
        assume they had thought up what is possibly the stupidest band name ever. 
        June did not agree with me though; I feel her ambivalence is due to her 
        thinly veiled esteem regarding the lead singer. <br>
        <br>
        They finally set up their instruments and played a set of raucous music. 
        June raptly watched the lead singer as he bobbed up and down, fingered 
        his bass and screamed unintelligible lyrics into the microphone. Paula 
        ran around the bar, chatting loudly with whom ever would pretend to listen 
        to her. <br>
        <br>
        Before starting their last song, the lead singer, sweaty from exertion, 
        looked out into the crowd and said, "This song is for a girl I know, she's 
        tough but sweet. I think you know who I'm talking about." <br>
        <br>
        He seemed to be looking in June's direction, but I could not pinpoint 
        who it was he was seeking. June, on the other hand, turned crimson as 
        the second sun on Katatonia. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="img/missionrpt_05_05_kiss.gif" width="208" height="157" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">He 
        sang his song and when the last note died down a tall girl with blond 
        dreadlocks jumped up on stage and wrapped her self around him. She appeared 
        to be attempting to suck his lungs right out of his mouth. I tried to 
        catch June's eye, but she was too busy picking lint off the hem of her 
        dress to notice me. The blond girl grabbed the microphone and screeched, 
        "I love you, Tristan James!!" <br>
        <br>
        So that must be his name. Rather odd. <br>
        <br>
        June looked ready to leave, and I don't blame her, since the music was 
        not that good and the smoke level was quadruple what it was when we walked 
        in. We found Paula in a rapt conversation with a man wearing a heavy black 
        leather jacket adorned with spikes. <br>
        <br>
        "So then I was like, "You destroyed my car!" And she was like, "Where 
        did you learn to drive, the bumper cars down on Coney Island? And then 
        I said &#150;" <br>

        June interrupted her before we found out what she said. "Paula, we want 
        to leave." <br>
        <br>
        "Now? It's just starting to get fun! Broken Gear is going on next! They 
        have the hottest drummer ever!" <br>
        <br>
        We pulled Paula away from the burly leather clad man and left. I looked 
        back once and saw Tristan James and his blond attached at the face. June 
        stared stonily forward. <br>
        <br>
        We walked back to the car, June and I remained silent as Paula chattered 
        away like a broken record. <br>
        <br>
        We returned home without mishap. <br>
