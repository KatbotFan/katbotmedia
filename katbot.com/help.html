			features the hottest, most cutting-edge content on the Internet, including 
			full-motion animation, games and music. To offer you the most amazing site 
			possible we have used a few of the most popular browser plugins available on 
			the Internet: Shockwave Flash, Apple Quicktime and RealPlayer G2 (or another 
			MP3 Player). We will help you detect which plugins you currently have installed, 
			and shows you where to download plugins you do not already have.<br>
			<br>
			Before we list the plugins you will need, please be sure the volume on your 
			<br>
			system is turned on. <br>
			<br>
			<b>List of Plugins:</b> <br>
			<br>
			Macromedia's Flash is required to view and navigate the site. <br>
			<br>
			Shockwave is required to play games on Katbot.com <br>
			<br>
			RealPlayer is required to listen to Katbot's MP3 collection. <br>
			<br>
			<b><br>
			For Netscape users:</b> <br>
			If you are using Netscape to surf the web, we have provided a page to automatically 
			detect which plugins you currently have installed. On the next page, you will 
			see a listing of all of your plugins installed in your browser. <br>
			<br>
			1. Click <a href=www.katbot.com/help/plugindetection">here</a> to view the 
			special plugin detection page <br>
			<br>
			2. Verify that "Flash" is featured on the page. We recommend Shockwave Flash 
			4 for the best performance. Underneath the large type that says "Flash," it 
			should tell you which version of Flash you have installed (i.e. "Flash 4.0" 
			indicates that you have Flash 4 installed). -If you cannot find it, then you 
			need to <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash"> 
			Download Shockwave Flash</a>. <br>
			<br>
			3. Verify that "RealPlayer(tm)" is featured on that page. If you cannot find 
			it, then you need to <a href=
"http://www.real.com/products/player/index.html"> Download RealPlayer G2</a>. 
			<br>
			<br>
			<b><br>
			For America Online users:</b> <br>
			Although we currently have no way to test which plugins you have installed 
			on your computer if you are using AOL 4.0 to view the site, your computer should 
			automatically download and install any plugins you do not currently have on 
			your browser. When your browser asks you if you would like to install the plugin, 
			make sure to accept the plugin or it will not install correctly. We highly 
			recommend using AOL 4.0 to view the site, and cannot guarantee that all content 
			will work correctly with older versions of AOL. <br>
			<b><br>
			For Internet Explorer users: </b><br>
			Although we currently have no way to test which plugins you have installed 
			on your computer if you are using IE4 or higher to view the site, your computer 
			should automatically download and install any plugins you do not currently 
			have on your browser. When your browser asks you if you would like to install 
			the plugin, make sure to accept the plugin or it will not install correctly. 
			We highly recommend using IE4 or higher to view the site, and cannot guarantee 
			that all content will work correctly with older versions of Internet Explorer.<br>
			<b><br>
			Additional notes:</b> <br>
			<br>
			<b>RealPlayer: </b><br>
			Some users have experienced difficulty playing RealPlayer audio tracks even 
			though they have installed the RealPlayer correctly. If you are accessing the 
			Internet from a corporate firewall there is a possibility that your network 
			administrators have closed the ports used by RealPlayer to stream audio (and 
			video). Contact your network administrator for assistance if you are behind 
			a firewall and cannot connect to MP3 or other media files.</font></td>
