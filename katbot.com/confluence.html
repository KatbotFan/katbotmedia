       <p> <br>
        This morning started out like most of the mornings I have experienced 
        on Earth thus far. I woke, cleaned myself, and then made my way to the 
        breakfast nook. Along the way I passed June, who was stumbling her way 
        to the bathroom. Her face turned paler than usual when she saw me. She 
        tried to articulate something, but it came out as an unintelligible grunt. 
        I figured she was tired. I heard her late last night, pounding on the 
        computer keyboard in her room. I wonder what she's writing about all the 
        time. <br>
        <br>
        When I entered the kitchen Mrs. LeBore let out a piercing shriek. "OH 
        MY GAWD!" she exclaimed, "That is the <i>best</i> costume I've ever seen!" 
        <br>
        <br>
        That is when I realized that my Hypno-Fa&ccedil;ade was not functioning. 
        <br>
        <br>
        "Howard, look at Katerina! How adorable!! What are you supposed to be, 
        dear? A green cat? Oh! How original! OH! And look! She's got antennas! 
        Fabulous!" <br>
        <br>
        Mr. LeBore smiled at me and went back to reading the Science section of 
        the New York Times. <br>
        <br>
        I excused myself (with out getting any bacon, I might add) and went back 
        to my room. I tried to reboot the Hypno-Fa&ccedil;ade, to no avail. I 
        then sent an emergency requisition to the KSA for a new Hypno-Fa&ccedil;ade 
        chip. <br>
       </p>
       <img src="research/img/missionrpt_06a_01_breakfast.gif" width="208" height="157" alt="kitchen scene" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5"> 
       <p>When I got back to the kitchen June was there. She eyed me suspiciously 
        as her mother droned on and on about my clever "costume." <br>
        <br>
        "Doesn't Katerina look fantastic June? You should have gotten dressed 
        up today. You used to come up with the most creative Halloween costumes! 
        What were you the last time you dressed up? The leafy bush? You looked 
        so cute!" <br>
        <br>
        "I wasn't a leafy bush, I was the <i>grassy knoll</i>. And I got creamed 
        that year. It took me weeks to get the eggshells out of my hair. Never 
        again." She glanced at me with disdain. <br>
        <br>
        My appearance got mixed reactions at school. Most of the teachers praised 
        my creativity, but I could sense an undercurrent of hostility emanating 
        from some of the students. I get the feeling that dressing up for Halloween 
        is behavior that is shunned once you reach High School age. There was 
        one student, however, who was both in a costume <i>and</i> who also resented 
        my appearance. That student was Courtney. <br>
        <br>
        I overheard her talking to a select group pretty girls as she opened her 
        locker. <br>
        <br>
        "Wow Courtney! What a great costume! Where did you get it?" asked the 
        blonde cheerleader who is dating Todd, June's bus tormenter. She was wearing 
        her cheerleader outfit, which doesn't really count as a costume, since 
        she wears it at least every other day. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="research/img/missionrpt_06a_02_courtney.gif" width="208" height="157" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="courtney the cat">"After 
        <i>Cats</i> left Broadway they auctioned off costumes and props on the 
        Internet. My daddy bought me Bombalurina's costume, since she was always 
        my favorite Jellical cat." <br>
        <br>
        "You're totally going to win the costume contest Courtney!" <br>
        <br>
        "Oh, I don't know. I mean, I haven't seen any costumes better than mine 
        yet, but it's still early in the d--" <br>
        <br>
        Courtney's mouth dropped open when she saw me. She then squinted and her 
        mouth shriveled up to the size of a small, withered prune. I got the distinct 
        feeling that I was treading on her territory. The only thing she was missing 
        was a puffed up tail. I ducked into my homeroom and tried to be inconspicuous. 
        My efforts were quite in vain. Everyone wanted to know what I was supposed 
        to be and where I got my "costume" from. I can only thank the Katatonian 
        Elders that these humans are so incredibly dim-witted. <br>
        <br>
        I was in for an unsettling surprise during lunch. I was not aware that 
        humans give out prizes for "Best Costume" on Halloween. Despite my anxiety 
        about being exposed as an outsider, I felt that to resist the humans' 
        desire to single out an individual to set on a pedestal would exacerbate 
        my predicament. <br>
        <br>
        The public address system crackled and the tinny voice of Principal Warner 
        filled the room, which immediately became silent. <br>
        <br>
        "Attention Students! I am pleased to announce the winner of this year's 
        Spooktacular Halloween Costume Contest!" One could hear paper rustling 
        in the background. "The winner is our very own exchange student, Katerina 
        Bottynski who is dressed as..." Here principal Warner paused, then continued 
        in a muffled voice, "What is she supposed to be?" There was more rusting 
        paper. "Katerina is dressed as a green cat, with antennas! An alien feline, 
        if you will. Please congratulate our winner!" <br>
        <br>
        Several people clapped. June kept boring holes in my skull with her sullen 
        gaze and Courtney looked extremely displeased. I was never so glad to 
        hear a school bell ring in my entire life. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="research/img/missionrpt_06a_03_prize.gif" width="208" height="157" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="blue ribbon">Later 
        in the day, I was presented with a blue ribbon which proclaimed that I 
        was "#1." How utterly charming. Mrs. Marr, who pinned the ribbon <i>on 
        to my chest</i>, babbled on and on about how creative I was and how proud 
        she was to see school spirit in one who is so new to Hicksville High and 
        also to America. Mrs. Marr was dressed as a witch, which I am sure some 
        students might find extremely apropos. June waited and rolled her eyes. 
        After Mrs. <br>
        Marr wandered back to the teachers' lounge, June said, "Are you happy 
        now? We missed the damn bus." She then spun around and walked out of the 
        school. I followed. <br>
        <br>
        On our way home, we passed hoards of children dressed up as Power Puff 
        girls and Pokemon characters. Most of the packs were accompanied by adults 
        who shook their heads when the saw me. The children just giggled into 
        their chocolate stained hands. <br>
        <br>
        As we rounded the corner of Elm Street, a group of boys appeared around 
        the opposite corner. They were covered from head to toe with white foam. 
        I did not think this boded very well for us, and neither did June who 
        said, "Shit." <br>
        <br>
        I didn't know what the boys were up to, but I could sense high levels 
        of animosity emanating from them. The leader spoke. <br>
        <br>
        <img src="research/img/missionrpt_06a_04_todd.gif" width="208" height="157" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5" alt="todd">"Well, 
        if it isn't the freak and her Russian side kick." <br>
        <br>
        Judging by his voice, the leader was Todd. <br>
        <br>
        "Courtney said you'd be walking home today. It's a really bad day to miss 
        the bus." <br>
        <br>
        "What's your problem, Todd? You sick of beating up on middle school kids? 
        You got to attack unarmed girls now?" June said. <br>
        <br>
        "Oh, sure," replied Todd. "This is going to be real fun." <br>
        <br>
        His band of accomplices snickered and shook their shaving cream cans. 
        They walked towards us. June looked around for somewhere to hide. As the 
        boys got closer I reached back and pulled the mini incendiary extinguisher 
        off my jetpack. All it took was one shot. The boys were knocked back fifty 
        feet by the force of the dry extinguisher device. The shaving cream cans 
        exploded and Todd screamed like a little girl. <br>
        <br>
        "I'm going to kill you!" <br>
        <br>
        June grabbed my hand and shouted, "Run!" <br>
        <br>
        She did not have to tell me that. <br>
        <br>
        We ran, and we did not stop until we reached home.<i> <br>
        </i><br>
        My replacement Hypno-Fa&ccedil;ade chip was waiting for me when I reached 
        the safety of Junior LeBore's room. Now that was a grand treat. <i><br>
