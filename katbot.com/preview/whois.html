			(aka Katerina Bottynski) was the runt in a litter of 13, eight of whom survived. 
			Her mother died tragically during childbirth, and as her father was unknown, 
			Katbot and her siblings were sent to the Katatonia Orphanage. Due to her diminutive 
			stature and reluctance to act sweet, she was never adopted. Instead, Katbot 
			witnessed all of her brothers' and sisters' adoptions; she never saw them again. 
			<br>
			<br>
			She studied at the Katatonia National Academy, where her high IQ was evident, 
			but she failed to "live up to her potential." Katbot was a mediocre student, 
			but excelled in her Earth Studies classes. She managed to graduate in the middle 
			of her class of 2500, with a major in Human Behavioral Science and a minor 
			in Societal Transformations of Post-Disco Era America. <br>
			<br>
			After graduation, Katbot entered the Katatonia Security Agency (KSA) Training 
			Program to pursue her dream of visiting Earth. While training for her Earth 
			assignment, she has worked as a Paper Pusher in the Human Behavioral Research 
			Department. After two years of arduous work, she purchased her prized possession; 
			a used Katalyst Neo adorned with custom painted hot rod flames. During a routine 
			service check, she met Eddie, a musician and gas station attendant. They quickly 
			fell in love, or at least they luxuriate in rubbing up against each other. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Katbot successfully completed her Earth Simulation Training (EST) and applied 
			for a research assignment on Earth. Her plan was to study the music scenes 
			in Seattle, New York City and Austin. KSA determined her attitude level to 
			be incredibly subversive and negative. So, she was assigned to the suburbs 
			where she could really make an impact. Her cool exterior will allow her to 
			observe the humans surreptitiously, and her urge to rock will lead her to adventures 
			she never imagined. <br>
			<br>
			As our story opens... <br>
			<br>
			We begin viewing Katbot's first Mission Report back to the KSA As Katbot rocks 
			out in her apartment, she explains how she has been waiting for her big research 
			assignment on Earth. We discover what her life has been like before landing 
			on earth, how she worked at a boring but well paying job at the Katatonia Security 
			Agency and we are introduced to her special friend, Eddie, who aspires to be 
			a rock star. We witness the mechanical sputnik who gives Katbot her long awaited 
			assignment: She is to be sent to Earth, but not to New York City, like she 
			had hoped. No, Katbot is sent to Hicksville, a town buried deep in the heart 
			of Long Island. Suburbia. Katbot is not pleased, but she accepts the mission 
			as part of her job, and says goodbye to Eddie and to Katatonia. She finally 
			arrives on Earth in the guise of Katerina Bottynski, a foreign exchange student 
			from an undisclosed Eastern European nation. Her host family, The LeBores, 
			welcome her with open arms, although their daughter June seems suspicious... 
			As for their pet cat, Mr. Fluff, it's love at first sight.</font></td>
