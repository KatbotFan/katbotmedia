			<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Katbot is a 
				web-based character who lives in a uniquely interactive environment, blending 
				animation, multi-media stories, and interactive features which combine to 
				form an engaging user experience. You are invited to become part of this world. 
				Come log-on and see the world through Katbot's eyes. <br>
				<br>
				She is the first living being from outer space to have a fully functional 
				desktop that's open to the public on the World Wide Web. Katbot.com is what 
				Katbot sees when she turns her computer on. We see what she sees. If she gets 
				an e-mail, we can read it. If she sets up a hidden web cam, we can see it. 
				This type of interface gives us deep access into her life. <br>

				<br>
				Created by Funny Garbage cyber femme Angela Martini, Katbot is a new kind 
				of interactive experience. It offers a unique style of entertainment as a 
				3 dimensional experience. Unlike the standard 2-D site, that only presents 
				the user with a fixed segment of content, Katbot.com is a live 24-7 presentation 
				of Katbot's daily life; much more like a web cam than a TV show. But it's 
				not just a web cam. We learn about Katbot by watching the latest animations, 
				playing interactive games, downloading Kat treats, and reading the journals 
				and reports of those who are closest to Katbot, including those of Katbot 
				herself. The site gives the audience a wide view into Katbot's perspective 
				of the world (which is, in fact, our world). Though she appears neon green 
				on our monitors, Katbot is disguised as a suburban high school student in 
				reality. The people around her see a girl who looks like everyone else, while 
				on-screen, we see her funky green fur. And though the site exists in real 
				time, we can still move back along the timeline to catch anything we might 
				have missed in the past. In addition, our input will actually change the content 
				of the site. We can e-mail Katbot and have our e-mail show up in Katbot's 
				mailbox, allowing her to respond if she chooses. <br>
				<br>
				Though there is a lot to check out here, Katbot.com is a flexible site that 
				offers an enjoyable experience regardless of time spent logged-on. Casual 
				users can enjoy the individual components of the site, like cool animations 
				and fun games, while more involved users can experience the site as a whole 
				by investing more time to closely follow Katbot's life. Through Katbot's daily 
				digital actions, we learn about her life, share her experiences, and begin 
				to understand more about our world and ourselves. <br>
